MazeRunner SDK Documentation
============================

This library implements a convenient client for MazeRunnerâ„¢ API for Python.
Using this library, you will be able to easily configure and manipulate the key features
of MazeRunner, such as the creation of a deception campaign, turning decoys on or off, deployment on
remote endpoints, and inspecting alerts with their attached evidence.

For a quick start, it's recommended to perform the easy steps in the installation section, and
continue to trying some of the usage examples in the mazerunner/samples folder.
